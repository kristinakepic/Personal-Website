    <p><b>BB4Learning:</b> I created this website as a project for the company Building Blocks for Learning.
     This was the second website I ever created and I got to enhance the skills that I had learned with my first website.
     These skills include HTML, CSS, and Wordpress. I also had to create the site under the company head and listen to her
      specifications for the website.<br><b>Link:</b>

    <p><b>Christmas is for Children:</b> I created this website as a volunteer project for the non-profit Christmas is for Children.
    This project taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, Wordpress, and Graphic Design. In order to create this site I had to work with
    a comitee of board members for the non-profit. In order for us all to agree on the specifications and design choices of the
    website I had to practice compromise and leadership skills. <br><b>Link:</b>
