    <p>I am a computer science major at The University of Texas at Dallas. I am currently enrolled in the honors program CS^2, 
      which gives a more in depth curriculum focused on high-level problem solving. I am currently planning on getting both a 
      bachelors and masters degree with a specialization in Information Assurance by May 2023. I am particularly interested in 
      cybersecurity, machine learning, web development, and data analysis. I have a passion for problem solving and technology which has 
      inspired my current career and educational path. Outside of computer science, my interests include tennis, working out, volunteering, and theater. </p>

      <h/2><b>Current Projects:</b></h2>
	<p style="text-align: justify">I'm currently working on a "Three in a Line Project". This will create a game similar to "Connect 4"
	where a player will play against a computer to try and get three of the same tiles in a row. This project will be created in the assembly
	language MIPS. By doing this project I hope to learn more about how assembly languages work and how to do complicated programs as efficiently
	as possible. I am also currently learning SQL in my freetime with the hopes to learn more about data and databases to eventually do a project in SQL.</p>

       <h/2><b>What I've Been Learning:</b></h2>
	<p style="text-align: justify">I've currently been learning data structures and assembly language. The last data structure I implemented was a hash table and 
	I am currently learning how to implement graphs. I have really enjoyed learning about all the different data structures which so far have included AVL trees,
	Red-Black trees, Binomial Heaps, and Binary Heaps, Skip Lists and Hash Tables. I have also been learning the assembly language MIPS which has taught me a lot
	about how computer memory works and it's the first low-level language I've ever learned. In my free time outside of a classroom setting I have been learning 
	SQL to better understand data and databases.</p>
