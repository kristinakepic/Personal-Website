    <p>I am a computer science major at The University of Texas at Dallas. I am currently enrolled in the honors program CS^2, which gives more in depth curriculum focused on high-level problem solving.
	I am currently planning on getting both a bachelors and masters degree with a specialization in Information Assurance by May 2023.
        I am paticularly interested in cybersecurity, machine learning, web development, and data analysis. I have a passion for problem solving and
        technology which has inspired my current career and educational path. Outside of computer science, my interests include tennis, working out,
        volunteering, and theater.  </p>

      <h/2><b>Current Projects:</b></h2>
	<p style="text-align: justify">I'm currently working on a "Three in a Line Project". This will create a game similiar to "Connect 4" where a player
           will play against a computer to try and get three of the same tiles in a row. This project will be created in the
           assembly language MIPS. By doing this project I hope to learn more about how assembly languages work and how to do
           complicated programs as efficiently as possible.</p>

       <h/2><b>What I've Been Learning:</b></h2>
	<p style="text-align: justify">I've currently been learning data structures and assembly language. The last data structure I implemented
         was a probalistic skip list and my next data structure will be a hash table. I have really enjoyed learning about all the diferent data structures
         which so far has included AVL trees, Red-Black trees, Binomial Heaps, and Binary Heaps in addition to the afformentioned Skip Lists and Hash Tables.
         I have also been learning the assembly language MIPS which has taught me a lot about how computer memory works and it's the first low-level language 
         I've ever learned.</p>
